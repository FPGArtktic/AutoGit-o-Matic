# AutoGit-o-Matic - Example Configuration File
# Copy this file as autogit-o-matic.ini and customize it to your needs

[SETTINGS]
# Log format. Available options: TXT, JSON
log_format = TXT

[PULL]
# Paths to repositories you want to update using 'git pull'
# You can provide a direct path to a repository
/home/user/git/repository1/

# You can also provide a parent directory containing multiple repositories
# The script will automatically detect all Git repositories in this directory
/home/user/git/projects/

# Alternative syntax using 'path =' is also possible
path = /home/user/git/important-project/

[FETCH]
# Paths to repositories you want to update using 'git fetch'
# 'fetch' downloads changes but doesn't merge them automatically, which is safer
# for repositories you're actively working on
/home/user/git/working-repository/

# As with the [PULL] section, you can specify a parent directory
/home/user/git/repositories-to-monitor/

# Comments start with '#' or ';'
; path = /home/user/git/another-project/

# [EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER SECTION]
# Future versions may support additional sections
# for other Git operations such as status, push, etc.
